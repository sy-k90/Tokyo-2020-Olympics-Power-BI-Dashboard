# Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes data from the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games to explore athlete performance, medal distributions, and personnel demographics across participating countries. Using data analytics and visualization, the goal is to uncover insights into factors influencing Olympic success.

## Data Description

The datasets used in this project include:

- **athletes.csv**: Personal details of all athletes.
